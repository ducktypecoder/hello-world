## Step 2: Say My Name

Great! Let's make another function. This new function will accept an argument.

Make a file in '/src' named 'say-my-name.js' and in that file export a function that returns your name:

```
module.exports = function sayMyName(name) { return name; };
```

Again, check with ducktypecoder:

```$ ducktypecoder next```
